### Note

This tool is currently under development and is still considered to be in "pre-release" stage.


### Prerequisites

GalaxyHistoryBrowser is written in Java. To build the project from source you will need:

* [Java JDK 8](https://www.java.com) - programming language
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - build and dependency manager


### Download Git repository

```
git clone https://github.com/kjetilkl/galaxy_history_browser.git
```


### Building from source

To compile the Java files and package the project, go into the directory containing the "pom.xml" file and run the Maven command:

```
mvn package
```

Maven will package GalaxyHistoryBrowser in a JAR-file and place it in the "target" subdirectory. Other dependencies will be placed in "target/lib". 


## Running GalaxyHistoryBrowser

To start GalaxyHistoryBrowser, go into the "target" directory and run:

```
java -jar GalaxyHistoryBrowser-1.0.jar
```

This will start up GalaxyHistoryBrowser with a graphical user interface. You can also run the program as a pure command-line tool by supplying the path to a local file or URL
that points to a Galaxy History Archive file (tar.gz format).

```
java -jar GalaxyHistoryBrowser-1.0.jar <filepath|URL>
```
